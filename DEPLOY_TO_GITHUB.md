# üöÄ GitHub Deployment Instructions

Your 3D Battleground game is now ready to be deployed to GitHub!

## üìã Steps to Deploy

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `battleground-3d` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "3D multiplayer FPS game with team modes and dual weapon system"
4. Choose **Public** (so others can play it)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create repository**

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\sride\OneDrive\Documents\VIBE-AI-THON\battleground-3d"

# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/battleground-3d.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your game files uploaded
3. The README.md will be displayed on the main page

## üåê Deploy to GitHub Pages (Optional)

To make your game playable online directly from GitHub:

### Option 1: Settings Method
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select **main** branch
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait a few minutes, your game will be live at:
   `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/battleground-3d/`

### Option 2: gh-pages Branch (For static hosting)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\sride\OneDrive\Documents\VIBE-AI-THON\battleground-3d"

# Create gh-pages branch
git checkout -b gh-pages
git push -u origin gh-pages

# Go back to main
git checkout main
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Backend Server
GitHub Pages only hosts **static files** (HTML, CSS, JS). The multiplayer features require the Python server (`server.py`) to be running.

For multiplayer to work online, you need to:
1. **Deploy the backend** to a cloud service like:
   - Heroku (free tier available)
   - Railway.app (free tier available)
   - Render.com (free tier available)
   - PythonAnywhere (free tier available)

2. **Update the Socket.IO connection** in your game files to point to your hosted server

### Single Player Mode
The game works perfectly in single-player mode on GitHub Pages:
- Solo mode
- Duo mode (with AI teammates)
- Squad mode (with AI teammates)
- All features except real-time multiplayer with other human players

## üîÑ Updating Your Game

Whenever you make changes:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\sride\OneDrive\Documents\VIBE-AI-THON\battleground-3d"

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## üì± Sharing Your Game

Once deployed, share your game with:
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/battleground-3d`
- Live game (if using GitHub Pages): `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/battleground-3d/`

## üéÆ What's Included

‚úÖ All game files committed
‚úÖ .gitignore configured
‚úÖ README.md with full documentation
‚úÖ requirements.txt for Python dependencies
‚úÖ Server files (server.py)
‚úÖ Complete game assets

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**If you get authentication errors:**
1. GitHub now requires Personal Access Tokens instead of passwords
2. Go to: Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
3. Generate a new token with "repo" permissions
4. Use the token as your password when prompted

**Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop**
1. Download GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open the app
3. Add your local repository
4. Publish to GitHub with one click

## üéâ Success!

Your game is now version-controlled and ready to share with the world!

Next steps:
- Add screenshots to README
- Create a demo video
- Share with friends
- Deploy backend for multiplayer
- Add to your portfolio
