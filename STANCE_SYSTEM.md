## üé® Visual Indicators

### Stance Display
- Located in **top-left HUD**
- Shows current stance in **bold text**
- Color-coded:
  - üü¢ **GREEN** = Standing
  - üü° **YELLOW** = Crouching
  - üü† **ORANGE** = Prone

### Player Model Changes
- **Crouching**: Body compressed vertically, legs bent
- **Prone**: Body rotated 90¬∞, lying flat on ground
- **Smooth transitions** between all stances

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Smooth Transitions
- All stance changes use **lerp interpolation** (15% per frame)
- Height transitions are gradual, not instant
- Camera height adjusts smoothly
- Model scaling updates in real-time

### Gameplay Balance
- **Standing**: Best for mobility and combat
- **Crouching**: Balance between stealth and movement
- **Prone**: Maximum cover, minimum mobility

### Restrictions
- Can only jump when **standing**
- Can only run when **standing**
- Must be on ground to change stance
- Prone has most restricted movement

---

## üéØ Strategic Uses

### When to Crouch
- Taking cover behind obstacles
- Moving quietly through enemy territory
- Reducing your hitbox in combat
- Approaching enemies without being seen

### When to Go Prone
- Maximum cover behind low obstacles
- Sniping from a stationary position
- Hiding in tall grass or bushes
- Avoiding detection when enemies nearby
- Emergency evasion when low on health

### When to Stand
- Active combat and shooting
- Quick repositioning
- Jumping over obstacles
- Fastest movement speed with Shift

## üîÑ How It Works

### Stance Toggle Logic

```

### Model Adaptation

- Collision detection uses current height

## üí° Tips & Tricks

1. **Quick Cover**: Press X to instantly drop prone when under fire
2. **Peek Shooting**: Crouch behind cover, stand to shoot, crouch again
3. **Stealth Approach**: Use prone to cross open areas undetected
4. **Speed vs Safety**: Stand for speed, crouch for balance, prone for safety
5. **Combat Stance**: Crouch in firefights to reduce your hitbox

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Possible Additions:
- **Lean Left/Right** (Q/E keys)
- **Slide mechanic** (Shift + C while running)
- **Stamina system** (affects stance duration)
- **Stance-based accuracy** (more accurate when prone)
- **Movement noise** (prone is silent, running is loud)
- **Stance-specific animations** for shooting
- **Cover system** (auto-crouch near walls)
