### Event Flow Examples

**Player Movement:**
```
Player 1 moves → Send position to server (50ms) → 
Server broadcasts to Players 2 & 3 → 
They update Player 1's position on their screen
```

**Shooting:**
```
Player 1 clicks → Create bullet locally → 
Send shoot event to server → 
Server broadcasts to all → 
Players 2 & 3 create same bullet → 
Everyone sees the bullet flying
```

**Damage:**
```
Bullet hits Player 2 → Send damage event → 
Server validates hit → Updates Player 2 health → 
Broadcasts damage to all → 
Everyone sees Player 2's health bar decrease
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- ⚠️ No player authentication (anyone can join)
- ⚠️ No anti-cheat (clients can send fake data)
- ⚠️ Limited to ~50 players per server (eventlet limitation)
- ⚠️ No lag compensation (high ping = disadvantage)

### Potential Improvements
- Add client-side prediction for smoother movement
- Implement server-side validation for all actions
- Add interpolation for remote player movement
- Use dedicated game server (Node.js game servers)
- Implement zones/sharding for 100+ players

---

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Performance
- Keep update rate at 50ms (20 FPS) for smooth gameplay
- Only send position updates when player moves
- Compress data before sending over network
- Use object pooling for bullets

### Debugging
- Check browser console (F12) for Socket.IO connection
- Check Flask terminal for server logs
- Use `console.log` to track event flow
- Monitor network tab for WebSocket messages

### Security
- Validate all server-side data
- Rate limit player actions
- Add authentication before deploying publicly
- Sanitize all user inputs
