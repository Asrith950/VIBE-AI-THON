# üîß Bug Fixes: Camera Stability & Mouse Cursor

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **First-Person View Not Stable When Running** üé•

**Problem:**
- Camera was bouncing too much when running (Shift key)
- Head bobbing was too intense (0.08 units vertical, 12 speed multiplier)
- Gun sway was excessive during sprinting
- Made aiming difficult while moving fast

**Solution:**
- **Reduced bob amount when running**: 0.08 ‚Üí **0.04** (50% less)
  - Now running has LESS bob than walking for better stability
- **Reduced bob speed**: 12 ‚Üí **9** (25% reduction)
- **Reduced gun sway when running**: 0.02 ‚Üí **0.01** (50% less)
- **Result**: Smooth, stable first-person view even at full sprint

**Code Changes (`js/game.js` line ~800):**
```javascript
// BEFORE
const bobSpeed = this.keys.shift ? 12 : 8; // Too fast when running
const bobAmount = this.keys.shift ? 0.08 : 0.05; // Too much bob

// AFTER
const bobSpeed = this.keys.shift ? 9 : 8; // Slightly faster bob when running
const bobAmount = this.keys.shift ? 0.04 : 0.05; // LESS bob for stability

// BEFORE
this.fpGun.position.x = 0.2 + Math.sin(time) * 0.02; // Same sway always

// AFTER
const swayAmount = this.keys.shift ? 0.01 : 0.02; // Less sway when running
this.fpGun.position.x = 0.2 + Math.sin(time) * swayAmount;
```

### 2. **Mouse Pointer Not Available on Login Screen** üñ±Ô∏è

**Problem:**
- Cursor was hidden globally with `body { cursor: none; }`
- Could not see cursor to click input field or button
- Pointer lock was being requested even on login screen
- Poor user experience - had to guess where to click

**Solution:**

#### A. CSS Changes (`styles.css`):
```css
/* BEFORE */
body {
    cursor: none; /* Hidden everywhere! */
}

/* AFTER */
body {
    cursor: default; /* Visible by default */
}

body.playing {
    cursor: none; /* Only hide during gameplay */
}
```

#### B. Added cursor styling to login elements:
```css
#login-screen {
    cursor: default; /* Visible cursor */
    pointer-events: all; /* Allow interaction */
}

.input-group input {
    cursor: text; /* Text cursor in input field */
}

#login-btn {
    cursor: pointer; /* Already had this */
}
```

#### C. JavaScript Changes (`js/game.js`):

**Start Game:**
```javascript
startGame() {
    this.hideStartScreen();
    this.isPlaying = true;
    
    // NEW: Hide cursor during gameplay
    document.body.classList.add('playing');
    
    // Create local player...
}
```

**Game Over:**
```javascript
showGameOver() {
    // NEW: Show cursor when game ends
    document.body.classList.remove('playing');
    
    document.getElementById('game-over').style.display = 'flex';
    // ...
}
```

**Click Handler:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
document.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (!this.isPlaying || !this.localPlayer || !this.localPlayer.isAlive) return;
    // ...
});

// AFTER
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    // NEW: Don't lock pointer if not in game
    if (!this.isPlaying) {
        return; // Exit early - allows normal clicking on login screen
    }
    
    if (!this.localPlayer || !this.localPlayer.isAlive) return;
    // ...
});
```

## Improved User Experience üéÆ

### Before:
- ‚ùå Camera bounced wildly when running
- ‚ùå Difficult to aim while moving fast
- ‚ùå No cursor on login screen (frustrating)
- ‚ùå Had to guess where to click

### After:
- ‚úÖ Smooth camera movement at all speeds
- ‚úÖ Can aim accurately while sprinting
- ‚úÖ Clear cursor visibility on UI screens
- ‚úÖ Professional user experience
- ‚úÖ FPS controls feel polished

---

## Technical Details

### Camera Bob Formula:
```javascript
// Vertical bobbing
targetCamPos.y += Math.sin(time * 2) * bobAmount;

// Where:
// time = Date.now() * 0.001 * bobSpeed
// bobSpeed = 8 (walking) or 9 (running)
// bobAmount = 0.05 (walking) or 0.04 (running) <- KEY CHANGE
```

### Gun Sway Formula:
```javascript
// Horizontal sway
this.fpGun.position.x = 0.2 + Math.sin(time) * swayAmount;
this.fpGun.position.y = -0.15 + Math.abs(Math.sin(time * 2)) * swayAmount;

// Where:
// swayAmount = 0.02 (walking) or 0.01 (running) <- KEY CHANGE
```

## Configuration Values

| Setting | Walking | Running (Before) | Running (After) |
|---------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Bob Speed | 8 | 12 | **9** |
| Bob Amount | 0.05 | 0.08 | **0.04** ‚≠ê |
| Gun Sway | 0.02 | 0.02 | **0.01** ‚≠ê |

**‚≠ê = Fixed for better stability**

## Files Modified

1. **js/game.js** (3 changes)
   - Line ~455: Click handler - exit early if not playing
   - Line ~625: startGame() - add 'playing' class to body
   - Line ~565: showGameOver() - remove 'playing' class
   - Line ~800: Reduced running bob amount and gun sway

2. **styles.css** (3 changes)
   - Line ~10: Changed body cursor from 'none' to 'default'
   - Line ~14: Added body.playing with cursor: none
   - Line ~275: Added cursor: default and pointer-events to login screen
   - Line ~335: Added cursor: text to input fields

---

## How It Works

### Cursor Management:
```
Login Screen ‚Üí cursor visible (default)
    ‚Üì
Enter name, click "JOIN GAME"
    ‚Üì
Start Screen ‚Üí cursor visible (default)
    ‚Üì
Click to start
    ‚Üì
Game Starts ‚Üí body.classList.add('playing') ‚Üí cursor: none
    ‚Üì
Playing game with FPS controls
    ‚Üì
Player dies
    ‚Üì
Game Over ‚Üí body.classList.remove('playing') ‚Üí cursor visible
    ‚Üì
Click "RESTART" ‚Üí back to gameplay
```

### Camera Stability:
- Walking: Normal bob (0.05 amount, speed 8)
- Running: **Reduced** bob (0.04 amount, speed 9)
  - Paradox: Running is faster movement but LESS camera shake
  - Reason: Stability is more important than realism at high speeds
  - Better for gameplay and aiming

## Future Enhancements

**Camera:**
- [ ] Add FOV increase when sprinting (like modern FPS games)
- [ ] Add camera shake when taking damage
- [ ] Add smooth camera transition between stances
- [ ] Option to disable head bobbing (accessibility)

**Cursor:**
- [ ] Custom crosshair cursor during gameplay
- [ ] Animated cursor on UI elements
- [ ] Cursor trails/effects
- [ ] Cursor visibility toggle key

## Summary

‚úÖ **Both issues completely resolved!**

1. **Camera Stability**: Reduced running bob by 50% and gun sway by 50% for smooth first-person experience
2. **Mouse Cursor**: Implemented proper cursor management - visible on UI, hidden in game

The game now feels professional and polished with responsive controls and proper UI interaction! üéÆ‚ú®
